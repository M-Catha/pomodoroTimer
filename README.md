# pomodoroTimer

A simple Pomodoro Timer modeled after the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

User can set custom length work session times and break times.

Clock will begin with the session time selected and automatically restart to the specified break time.

Once the break time is over, the clock will restart to another work session specified.

User can lengthen/shorten the work/break sessions but only during its given session (i.e. lengthen break during the break or shorten session during work session).

The session/break cycle on the clock is indefinite.

Clock is made using the [FlipClock.js library](http://flipclockjs.com/).
